### This is our First Year Team Project where we built a Web Application for flatmates of a shared apartment.

#### We had 3 main features which are: 
<ul> 
<li>Shared List</li>
<li>Shared Calendar</li>
<li>Money Tracker</li>
</ul></h3>

<b>Shared List:</b> Shared List was used like todo lists for the apartment or flat where you could add different lists for different purposes as per the wish of the users.

<b>Shared Calendar:</b> Shared Calendar was used for the users to add events which would be shown in everyone's calendar of the flat.

<b>Money Tracker:</b> The Money Tracker was used to show how much someone in the apartment owes you. It also showed simplified transactions based of the debts between users.

To access these features, the users either had to join a group using group id and password or create a new group.
